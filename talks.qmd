# Section Title

Some introductory text goes here.
Let's discuss the primary concepts.

Here is a warning.
Pay attention to this important detail as it could affect your results.

### Another Example

::: {style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 6px solid #cc0000; padding: 20px; margin-top: 20px;"}
```         
<strong>Note:</strong> This text uses a custom <span style="color: #cc0000;">red</span> border and <span style="color: #0000cc;">blue</span> text for certain words.
```

## Another one

::: {style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ffffff, #ffe6e6); padding: 50px;"}
```         
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3em;">Portfolio</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
    Whether youâ€™re looking for <span style="background-color: #1D3518;">crystal clear communication</span> of data insights, an 
    <span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">artistic response</span> to the data, or something between the two, I enjoy putting together 
    stand-out visuals which will keep the conversation going. From academic graphs to artistic commemorations, 
    via interactive visualisations, generative art and animations with a sense of humour, my portfolio features 
    a range of different styles, all coded straight from the data.

# Call out

<https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html>

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {#tip-example2 .callout-tip}
## - Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## - Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user.
You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip with Title from us"}
This is a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## - Pay Attention

Using callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.
<!-- see @tip-callout -->
:::

::: {#tip-example .callout-tip}
## - Cross-Referencing a Tip

Add an ID starting with `#tip-` to reference a tip.
:::

See @tip-example @tip-example2

# Annotating code

You can also add Annotation Style in the

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```

1.  Take `penguins`, and then,
2.  add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.

```{r}
#| column: page

knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]
)
```

```{r}
#| column: body

knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]
)
```

# Screen Column

You can have content span the full width of the page with no margin (full bleed).
use `screen` for full length, `screen-inset` for full screen with some margins

Image Example ::: {.column-screen-inset} ![](elephant.jpg) :::

Map Example

```{r}
#| column: screen-inset-shaded

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```
